# Equitable-AI-Development-Paths

This repo contains the data used by our paper "Non-Profit-Driven Development Paths for Equitable AI/AGI" accepted for publication at [ICRES 2023](https://clawar.org/icres2023/). The list of projects we used was updated to reflect the state of non-narrow AI/AGI projects in April of 2023 from the dataset provided by the [2020 Survey of Artificial General Intelligence Projects
for Ethics, Risk, and Policy](https://gcrinstitute.org/papers/055_agi-2020.pdf) from Fitzgerald et al [1]. 

The following steps were taken to update the project list from 2020.
1) Removed projects that have become defunct.
2) Removed projects that had changed direction away from the goal of non-narrow AI/AGI.
3) Updated projects names that had rebranded.
